<br>
Cool Cool Toon (クルクルトゥーン) is an interactive 3D rhythm-comic game developed by SNK for the Dreamcast, making it one of the last games the company developed for the console. The title is also capable of linking with its Neo Geo Pocket Color companion title, "Cool Cool Jam". Both titles were released on August 10th, 2000 in Japan. The games were never licensed or localized to any other country.
<br><br>
The gameplay has often been compared with another rhythm game at the time, "Space Channel 5", by fans and critics alike. Main visuals and character designs were done by comic book artist and illustrator, Ippei Gyoubu.
<br><br>
References to the game and some of its characters were later featured in one of the stages in "Neo Geo Battle Coliseum". 
<br><br>
In 2014, SNK Playmore released the mobile game "The Rhythm of Fighters", which features a similar gameplay.

<h2>Bonus Content</h2>
<img align="right" width="267" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/CoolCoolToon-EnglishPatchDreamcast/blob/main/bonus.gif?raw=true">Unique and brand new for this patch is a collection of bonus content for players to enjoy. To access this content, select "INTERNET GATE" from the main menu, which will launch a <a href="https://www.dreamcast-talk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=14611">modified version of the Dream Passport web browser</a>.
<br><br>
<ul>
 <li><b>100% Unlocked Save</b><br>A save file that can be downloaded directly to your VMU to unlock all stages, outfits, songs, and more! Note that this will prevent you from playing through Amp and Spica's stories from the beginning.</li>
 <br>
 <li><b>On-Disc Extras Page</b><br>The retail GD-ROM of "Cool Cool Toon" included a built-in "Omake", or "Extras", webpage. This baked-in page features fantastic artwork, including character portraits, artwork development pieces, title screens, wallpapers, and more!</li>
 <br>
 <li><b>Original Dricas Website</b><br>Dricas, the Japanese Dreamcast network website, hosted individual pages for a slew of games during the console's lifespan. Included here is the original "Cool Cool Toon" site, fully intact. For purposes of preservation, this content has been left untranslated.</li>
 <br>
 <li><b>Using Maracas</b><br>This game's little-known support for the Dreamcast maracas was documented on the retail GD-ROM itself. That documentation has been fully translated for all the crazy Dreamcast peripheral owners out there to try!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Neo Geo Pocket Color Link Feature</h2>
<img align="right" width="202" height="250" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/CoolCoolToon-EnglishPatchDreamcast/blob/main/link_cable.jpg?raw=true">A special <a href="https://segaretro.org/Neo_Geo_Pocket/Dreamcast_Setsuzoku_Cable">"Setsuzoku Cable"</a> (Link Cable) is required to make use of this feature, connecting the Neo Geo Pocket Color to the Dreamcast.
<br><br>
The companion game to "Cool Cool Toon" (called "Cool Cool Jam") for the Neo Geo Pocket Color follows the adventures of Wav and Midi in Musey Town, a neighboring city of Cool Cool Town. The main focus of this game is to start a band to find the way back home, using mini-games where the player needs to compose pieces with instruments.
<br><br>
Points earned in this game can be transferred to "Cool Cool Toon" on the Dreamcast, allowing players to unlock more costumes and characters. Conversely, unlocked characters and constumes from "Cool Cool Toon" on the Dreamcast can be transferred to "Cool Cool Jam" on the Neo Geo Pocket Color.
